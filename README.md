# Force-Directed Graph Layout (Fruchterman–Reingold)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95d404e-c042-44ad-83ca-2ed37204b79b

This project implements the Fruchterman–Reingold algorithm, a classic force-directed method for graph drawing.  
Nodes are treated as repelling particles while edges act as attractive springs, leading to aesthetically pleasing layouts that reveal graph structure.  

The implementation is written in C++ and demonstrates how simple physical metaphors can be used to compute graph layouts that are both visually clear and structurally meaningful.

I developed this project as the underlying algorithm to a mobile app I'm working on that displays your social connections in a visually pleasing way showing connections between friends and automatically aranging them using the graph algorithm implemented here. I then integrated it as a Flutter plugin into the mobile app. Below is an example of what this looks like in an early protoype. The full app is still under developement and will hopefully launch in the App Store and Play Store soon!
