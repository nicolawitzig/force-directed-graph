# Force-Directed Graph Layout (Fruchterman–Reingold)

This project implements the Fruchterman–Reingold algorithm, a classic force-directed method for graph drawing.  
Nodes are treated as repelling particles while edges act as attractive springs, leading to aesthetically pleasing layouts that reveal graph structure.  

The implementation is written in C++ and demonstrates how simple physical metaphors can be used to compute graph layouts that are both visually clear and structurally meaningful.

I developed this project as the underlying algorithm to a social network app I'm working on that computes the users underlying social graph and displays it in a visually pleasing format showing connections between friends.
